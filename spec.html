      <p>
        Changes in DOM elements above the visible region of a scroller can result
        in the page moving while the user is in the middle of consuming the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        This spec proposes a mechanism to mitigate this jarring user experience by
        keeping track of the position of an anchor node and adjusting the scroll
        offset accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This spec also proposes an API for web developers to opt-out of this behavior.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Today, users of the web are often distracted by content moving around due to
        changes that occur outside the viewport. Examples include script inserting an
        iframe containing an ad, or non-sized images loading on a slow network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically the browser's default behavior has been to preserve the absolute
        scroll position when such changes occur. This means that to avoid shifting
        content, the webpage can attempt to reserve space on the page for anything
        that will load later. In practice, few websites do this consistently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring aims to minimize surprising content shifts. It does this by
        adjusting the scroll position to compensate for the changes outside the
        viewport.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section dfn-for="ScrollAnchoring">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring works by selecting a DOM node (the <dfn>anchor node</dfn>) whose
        movement is used to determine the adjustment to the scroll position.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Anchor Node Selection</h3>
        <p>
          The user agent aims to select an anchor node that is deep in the DOM and close to the top
          edge of the <a id="ref-for-viewport-1">viewport</a>. This maximizes the amount of offscreen content whose
          changes the user agent will successfully compensate for, while avoiding undesired scrolling
          when important content loads within the viewport (for example, upon clicking a
          "Read More" link).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="anchoring-algorithm">algorithm to select an anchor node for a scrollable area </dfn>(either a
          document or an element with scrollable overflow) is as follows:
          <ol>
            <li>
              If the scrollable area is created by an element whose computed value of the
              <a href="#overflow-anchor">overflow-anchor</a> property is
              <a href="#overflow-anchor-none">none</a>, then do not select an anchor node.
            </li>
            <li>
              Otherwise, walk the DOM within the
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling-box">scrollable area</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each element E encountered by the walk
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If E is an <a href="#unsuitable-anchor" id="ref-for-unsuitable-anchor-1">unsuitable anchor node</a>, skip over E and its descendents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Otherwise, compare its bounds to the scrollable area's visible region.
                  <ol>
                    <li>If E is <a id="ref-for-fully-visible-1">fully visible</a>, terminate the walk and use E as the anchor node.</li>
                    <li>If E is <a id="ref-for-fully-clipped-1">fully clipped</a>, skip over E and its descendents.</li>
                    <li>
                      If E is <a id="ref-for-partially-visible-1">partially visible</a>, mark it as a "candidate"
                      and descend into its children. If the walk reaches the end of E without finding
                      another anchor node, use E as the anchor node. (Deeper nodes are preferred
                      in this case to avoid the failure mode of content being inserted
                      inside the anchor node but outside the viewport.)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>

            </li>
            <li>
              E's computed value of the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#propdef-position">position</a> property is <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#valdef-position-absolute">absolute</a> and E's
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-3/#containing-block">containing block</a>
              is an ancestor of the scrollable area.

              E's computed value of the <a href="#overflow-anchor">overflow-anchor</a>

        <p>
          A DOM element E is <dfn id="fully-visible">fully visible </dfn> if it is entirely
          within the <a id="ref-for-viewport-2">viewport</a>.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          A DOM element E is <dfn id="partially-visible">partially visible </dfn> if it is

        <h3>Scroll Adjustment</h3>
        <p>
          If an anchor node was selected, then when the anchor node moves,
          the browser computes its previous location L0 and
          its new location L1 in the coordinate space of the scrolling content. It then
          reads the current scroll position S0 and computes a new scroll position S1:
        </p>
        <p>
          <pre>S1 = S0 + (L1 - L0)</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          By setting the scroll position to S1 at the same time that the anchor node moves
          to L1, the location of the anchor node relative to the viewport is preserved, and
          no "jump" is visible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anchor node may be either a text node or an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conceptually, a new anchor node is computed whenever the scroll position
          changes. (As a performance optimization, the implementation may wait until the
          anchor node is needed before computing it.)
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          In some cases, a scroll anchoring adjustment is suppressed, even though
          the anchor node has moved. These are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the DOM changes that caused the adjustment include any change to the
              computed value of a property affecting the position of elements, on any
              element in the path from the anchor node to the scrollable element (or
              document), inclusive of both.
              <p class="issue">
                Need a clearer specification of which properties trigger this condition.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              When the DOM changes that caused the adjustment include a change to the
              computed value of the
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#propdef-position">position</a>
              property on any element within the scrollable element (or document), such that
              the element acquires or ceases to have an out-of-flow position
              (<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#fixed-pos">fixed</a> or
              <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position-3/#abs-pos">absolute</a>).

      <h2>Exclusion API</h2>
      <p>
        Scroll anchoring aims to be the default mode of behavior when launched, so that
        users benefit from it even on legacy content. A CSS property
        <dfn id="overflow-anchor"><code>overflow-anchor</code></dfn> can disable
        scroll anchoring in part or all of a webpage (opt out), or exclude portions
        of the DOM from the anchor node selection algorithm.
        This property supports the following values when applied to an element E:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <dfn><code>overflow-anchor: visible</code></dfn> declares that the DOM subtree
            rooted at E is eligible to participate in the <a href="#anchoring-algorithm"
            id="ref-for-anchoring-algorithm-1">anchor node selection algorithm</a>
            for any scrollable area created by E or an ancestor of E.
        </li>
        <li>
            <dfn id="overflow-anchor-none"><code>overflow-anchor: none</code></dfn>
            declares that the DOM subtree rooted at E is <em>not</em> eligible to
            participate in the <a href="#anchoring-algorithm"
            id="ref-for-anchoring-algorithm-1">anchor node selection algorithm</a>
            for any scrollable area created by E or an ancestor of E.
        </li>
        <li>
            <dfn><code>overflow-anchor: auto</code></dfn> invokes the user agent's default behavior for the
            element. With the launch of scroll anchoring this will be equivalent
            to <code>visible</code>, but is subject to future modification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="issue">
        The pairing of <code>visible</code> with <code>none</code> is awkward.
        We should come up with better names for these values.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        The <code>overflow-anchor</code> property is also proposed (with different values) for
        <a href="http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-sticky-scrollbars/">CSS Sticky Scrollbars</a>.
        This feature is distinct from scroll anchoring, but shares the notion of
        adjusting scroll position in response to content changes.
      </div>
      <p>
        The <code>overflow-anchor</code> property is not inherited.
